# web-design-challenge

In this challenge, we had to create a visualization dashboard website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

I created a landing page from where we can navigate to other pages, an individual page for each plot, a comparison page with all four plots, and a data page with provided CSV file. 

I added a navigation bar tool with a dropdown menu by using bootstrap and CSS commands. 
A navigation bar will be always visible, even when we scroll the page. 
At the bottom of each page, I added a footer.
